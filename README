Tickle
======

Thanks to http://github.com/jasonm/parallel_test for the concept.

Setup
=====

To install :

	$ script/plugin install git://github.com/lifo/tickle.git

Example
=======

To run all tests :

	$ rake tickle # This will use 2 processes by default

To run all tests using 3 processes :

	$ rake tickle[3]

To only run unit tests :

	$ rake tickle:units

To run unit tests in 4 parallel processes :
	
	$ rake tickle:units[4]
	
tickle:functionals and tickle:integration should work as expected.

Tuning
======

For best results, use tickle with Ruby Enterprise Edition and Twitter's GC settings :

Database Setup
==============

If you're NOT USING transactional fixtures, you'll need to create 'N' new databases. Where 'N' is the maximum number of parallel processes you want to run.

Assuming you want to run 2 proccesses, you'll need to provide test_1 and test_2 config settings in database.yml :

test_1:
  adapter: mysql
  encoding: utf8
  database: myapp_test1
  pool: 5
  username: root
  password:
  socket: /tmp/mysql.sock

test_2:
  adapter: mysql
  encoding: utf8
  database: myapp_test2
  pool: 5
  username: root
  password:
  socket: /tmp/mysql.sock
